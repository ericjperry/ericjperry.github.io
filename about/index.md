  Hey gang, my name&#8217;s Eric. I&#8217;m a pretty well rounded guy interested in all things technology. I&#8217;m a graduate of The Ohio State University, with a bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering. I spend my free time attempting to learn about mobile and web development (while working on <a href="http://quaffic.com/blog/">Quaffic</a>), playing rec sports, pwning the occasional newb, eating sushi, making people laugh, embarrassing myself publicly, and just hangin&#8217; out.
</p>

  My main focus in creating this site is to release some of my thoughts into the wild, teaching people through my experiences, and maybe providing some lucky reader with a laugh or two. Enjoy!
