Hey, everyone! Thanks for stopping by my blog. If you haven&#8217;t taken a look at the [About Me][1] page, well, then you have no idea what this blog is or who I am. In short, I&#8217;m just a software developer looking to share some ideas with anyone willing to listen. I&#8217;m going to try and keep this blog active and make sure I share some meaningful information as well as provide a bit of entertainment for anyone who stumbles in here.

I&#8217;m going to start working on my first legitimate post soon and hopefully provide a better idea of the kind of content that can be found here. I&#8217;m going to work hard to make sure you find something you enjoy reading here, so make sure to stop back in.

If for some reason you want to see more of me, there are some links on the right panel with my Twitter/Facebook/LinkedIn/G+. See ya soon!
